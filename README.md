# 10-ObjectOrientedProgramming_TeamProfileGenerator_Node.js_andJestUnitTests

## Task

The task in this exercise is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so we‚Äôll also write a unit test for every part of our code and ensure that it passes each test.

> **Note**: There is no starter code for this assignment.

## Installation Instructions: 
To generate your own team profile, first run 'npm install' or 'npm i' after cloning this repository to your local system in order to install the npm package dependencies as specified in the 'package.json'. Prior to proceeding type 'npm run test' to double check if the applications functioning using an embedded unit test called 'UnitTesting.test.js' in the tests folder. Upon reviewing the pass results, run this application using 'node index.js' and provide answers to the subsequent command line prompts. 

## User Story

```
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
```

```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
‚úì WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
‚úì WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
‚úì WHEN I click on the GitHub username THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
‚úì WHEN I start the application THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager‚Äôs name, employee ID, email address, and office number
‚úì WHEN I enter the team manager‚Äôs name, employee ID, email address, and office number THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
‚úì WHEN I select the engineer option THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer‚Äôs name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
‚úì WHEN I select the intern option THEN I am prompted to enter the intern‚Äôs name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
‚úì WHEN I decide to finish building my team THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
```
